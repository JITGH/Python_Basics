# 🐍 Python Basics Before ML

Welcome to this repository — a personal collection of Python fundamentals crafted as a stepping stone toward machine learning mastery.

## 📘 About This Folder

This folder contains essential Python practice files and mini-projects that helped me build a strong foundation before diving into ML frameworks. It’s designed to reinforce core programming concepts, improve coding fluency, and prepare for data-centric workflows.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
